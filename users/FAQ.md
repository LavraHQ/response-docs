## But what about XXXXXX CAD?

Response is much more powerful than _competing_ CAD systems. What other platforms offer typically
doesn't amount to the functionality that Response gives its users. We are working on a comparison for
each competitor, however, it's not quite ready yet.

## Do I need to create an account?

It depends. If you are primarily acting as a civilian, no. If you are acting as any other role, yes. Most civilian
activities can be completed without an account. However, some functionality is not available to civilians without
an account for security purposes.

## Why do I see the dark theme?

You may notice that you see the dark theme in Response by default while others may not. This is due to your Operating System preference.
You can override this setting using `Preferences` or by changing your OS settings to prefer light instead of dark.
